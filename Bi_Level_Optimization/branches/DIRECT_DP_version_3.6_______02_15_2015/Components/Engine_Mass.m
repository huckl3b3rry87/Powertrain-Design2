% STUFF THAT SCALES WITH TRQ & SPD SCALES (MASS AND INERTIA)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% fc_inertia=0.1*fc_pwr_scale;           % (kg*m^2), rotational inertia of the engine (unknown)
fc_max_pwr=(max(eng_consum_spd.*eng_max_trq)/1000); % kW     peak engine power
fc_base_mass=1.8*fc_max_pwr;            % (kg), mass of the engine block and head (base engine)
                                        %       mass penalty of 1.8 kg/kW from 1994 OTA report, Table 3 
fc_acc_mass=0.8*fc_max_pwr;             % kg    engine accy's, electrics, cntrl's - assumes mass penalty of 0.8 kg/kW (from OTA report)
fc_fuel_mass=0.6*fc_max_pwr;            % kg    mass of fuel and fuel tank (from OTA report)
fc_mass=fc_base_mass+fc_acc_mass+fc_fuel_mass; % kg  total engine/fuel system mass
